# Node JS

To get started with NodeJS, simply create a js file.

File `hello.js`:
```js
console.log("Hello World")
```

Run the file:
```sh
node hello.js
```

## Package Manager / Dependency Manager

NodeJS has several package manager.

- npm - the commonly known (aka the default) package manager
- yarn - package manager that doubles down as project manager
- pnpm - fast and storage efficient package manager

When downloading dependencies, NPM is usually slow.
PNPM is my preferred package manager.

## Init a project

1. `npm init`
2. `npm install <dependency>`
